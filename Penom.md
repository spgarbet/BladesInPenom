==The Flotilla of Hagarr of Paranta; 1st Imperial Marines==

The Imperium maintains a rather small navy. An invasion along the southern coast would be fraught with difficulties for any daring enough to attempt it, and no great threat is perceived from this quarter. About five hundred ships of various sizes are based at Penom and Jakalla, and perhaps another two or three hundred are kept at Vra, Tleku on Thayuri Isle, and at Petris Layoda on the island of Ganga. Each of these vessels is allotted a crew of sailors who fight at best as light infantry, plus a compliment of marines, who are armoured approximately in the fashion of medium land troops. The duties of these latter include fighting from ship to ship, occasionally landing to destroy pirate nests, and defending the souther shores against smugglers and others who would evade Imperial scrutiny.

In the _Time of Chaos_ after the downfall of the Engsvanyali Imperium there are legends of a might warrior, one Hagarr of Paranta (the exact place is now not known but is supposed to be Pry Teketl Head to the southeast of the city of Penom). Hagarr is said to have fought against the Hlyss, the Hlutrgu, various pirates, innumerable sea monsters and other such-like, and finally "sailed his great ship into the Islands of the Sky, where the Lords of Many Lights there did him homage." Still another legend has him perishing in the wastes of the now-dry Bay of Ssu'um, where travellers report seeing his metal-hulled vessel protruding from the sand-dunes from time to time.

There is no record of any unit of Imperial marines separate from land-based Legions until modern times, however. Earlier Emperors seem to have used Cohorts of the Legions occasionally to fight at sea, placing these troops under the command of one or another admiral of the fleet. The Red Sky Clan, of the city of Penom continued to claim direct descent from the original Hagarr, and various members of this clan are recorded as serving the Imperium in important capacities, military connections until the reign of Kurshetl Nikuma II "the Viewer of the Night." During this period the Red Sky Clan, which largely consists of worshippers of Karakan and his Cohort, Chegarra, joined in the defense of Penom against the incursions of pirates and the nonhuman Hlyss. A leader of this clan is described as collecting a force of sailors and other troops and setting sail for Ssam-ris Isle in the western reaches of the Great Gulf. There he defeated teh Mu'ugalavyani settlers and claimed the island in the name Tsolyanu. His descendants continued to dwell there until the Great War of 2020, when the Mu'ugalavyani landed on the island in force and took it back. Some members of the Red Sky Clan still live on the island and still speak of their "cousins" in Tsolyanu, although they are now completely adapted to Mu'ugalavyani customs and language.

In 2251 A.S. Arshu'u "the Ever-Splendid" commanded that certain Legions be raised to serve largely aboard ships as a counter to the souther pirates and the deadly Hlyss. One of these was to based at Penom, and it was the Red Sky Clan which offered to recruit troops and pay for the arms and armour of the unit. The ships, or course, were to be supplied by the Imperium. This led to a major scandal in 2305 A.S., when it was discovered that the clan was using its men and the ships to trade along the coast as far as Livyanu and Tsatsayagga in Salarvya. Not only were the coasts being guarded, said the clan leaders in reply, but we are also enriching the Empire through our commerce. The practice was ordered stopped forthwith, however, and sever or eight renegade captains were seized an impaled along with all their crews. Since then the ships of the Imperial navy are always officered by men who have no connection with the Clan of the Red Sky.

Aside from raids and local duty, the legion has seen no major military action. It is now commanded by a namesake of the ancient Hagarr, a man of the lineage of hi Chunmiyel, who is himself an excellent sailor and who owns a fleet of merchant ships apart from his military commission. He is rather old for active command, however, and hopes to hand the legion on to his son, Miridame hiChumiyel.

==The Armoured Vision of Death; 29th Imperial Medium Infantry==

A legion recently raised at Penom by Prince Dhich'une. The Prince has long sought to gain support from the Sarku worshippers of the southern marshlands. It is said that at least three cohorts of the undead (Shedra) are also ready at the Temple of the Fourth Worm just outside Penom. Rumor also has it that Vorodla and possibly certain other types of undead creatures are prepared to aid this legion. The general belongs to the Dark Fear Clan, is about 45 years of age, and is inexperienced--but he did serve for a time in the Legion of the Scales of Brown, and he thus knows something of military matters.

Yes, I have one. I am putting the finishing touches on it this weekend. I could post it to the ftp site(?) if you like. There really are a number of charming spots to visit in Penom -- I recommend the Dome of the Sweeping Sea, Garden of Amber Twilight, and the Villa of Copper Stairs (just outside of the city along the coastline). Do try to avoid the harbor area, though.

The party will wish to clean up at the local temple of Vimuhla, which is far from impressive, and leave for Tumissa as soon as possible. They will be interrogated first of all by Dremel hiSukosh of the Domed Tomb Clan, an official recently appointed to Penom. He is obnoxious in the extreme, and demands to know why the party returned from Pan Chaka by way of Penom. If they are stupid enough to tell him the whole story then he will confiscate the Cube ’for the glory of the Emperor’ and (since such a find might well represent his meal ticket out of here) he’ll require a very handsome bribe to give it back.

When Engsvan hla Ganga sank, Penom was apparently higher and drier than it is now. This is true all along the southern coast -- cf. the Fortress of Ngala in the swamps opposite Jakalla. I don't know *how much* higher and drier -- accounts differ -- but enough so that in some places there were houses and fields and even towns. When Ganga sank, the great tektonic plate to the north seems to have sunk somewhat with it, inundating the Swamps of Tsechelnu and parts of the plain northeast of Jakalla (since dried up and now excellent arable land again).

Penom has been singled out as a hell-hole for diseases and bugs since Bednalljan times, in spite of its being a little higher and drier, as noted in the preceding paragraph.

The average Tsolyani urban dweller knows more about flora and fauna, perhaps, than many of his Terran counterparts. His life is much more "back to nature" than that of a citizen of a large European/American city. The Tekumelani are closer to their ecology than Terrans might be. Every Tekumelani knows about Hmelu and Hma and Chlen-beasts. As long as an animal or plant occurs in the local environment, it will be familiar and known to all but a very few. One thus knows enough to avoid an Alash snake, or certain of the uglier insects of Penom. I would say that the average person, thus, is able to function as well as a Terran in similar circumstances, although the flora and fauna of a new and different region might initially be unfamiliar and require guidance from a local. For example, a Tsolyani travelling to Shenyu would have to learn to avoid the Shen delicacy, the Chr-melon. Just as you might rely upon a local or an exerpienced fellow-countryman here, so it is the same there. It is the same for a European who is introduced to that stinking but tasty fruit grown in Indonesia-Malaysia (I've forgotten its name), or somebody who tries to eat Manioc without processing all the potassium cyanide out of it! A month or two in a new place, and you learn enough of the ropes to survive.

“... Know ye, O Omnipotent Eye Which Sees the World, that your excellent son, Lord Eselne, has travelled to Chene Ho to visit his patron, Lord Kettukal. What this bodes is not yet apparent, for the latter continues to prostrate himself before the Petal Throne and declare his loyalty. Lord Eselne’s party was beset with Serudla near Atkolel Heights, but Hnalla smiled upon his fortunes, and he escaped harm, slaying three beasts. Such an incursion of these creatures upon the Sakbe Road is almost unheard of; troops were sent but found nothing amiss. Lord Eselne and Lord Kettukal continue to meet in apparent openness and loyalty, but they are watched closely. The affair is further muddied by the capture of a Mu’ugalavyani officer near Chene Ho; this person slew himself before he could be put to the question, and some device was used which prevented our priests from revivifying his body. Whether or not these occurrences are connected is as yet known only to the Gods... What action may be contemplated?” [There follows a glyph denoting “observe and report”: Translator.]

“ ... Know ye, O Tree of Life Whose Branches Overshadow the Universe, that matters continue to worsen between the Priests of Good and the Priests of Evil. Aside from that matter in Penom (passage deleted and replaced by the glyph “inserted into the Inner Book only”: Translator], there are reports from several cities. From the slums and stews of Purdimal there are reports of a reviving worship of the ancient and detestable Goddess of the Pale Bone, who antedates the Ten Gods and the Ten Cohorts; efforts made to stamp out her pernicious practices meet opposition from some of the half-human descendants of that race which dwelt there aforetimes. From Fasiltum come intelligences that priests of the two alignments have clashed in the streets, with some heads broken. From Thraya comes the news that young hotheads in the Temple of Chegarra attempted to raise the standards of a holy war to destroy all evil temples. As is known, only through maintaining the balance can the Empire prosper, and there are those on many sides who would tip it one way or the other. Should a holy war break out, the Yan Koryani would not be slow to seize the advantage. O our Lord, we pray for guidance!” [A series of glyphs follows which denote “make pretexts and seize those who lead these ‘hotheads’; make examples of them but with great discretion, that more may not arise; reward those who seek balance”: Translator.]

Upon that river was a barge containing a mighty and terrible Hlyss! My Lord, this being came to slay your priest but was at length defeated, whereupon your priest discovered several chests of Zu’ur, the deadly narcotic which has begun to plague your Empire. This greenish powder has been found in almost every city of the land, and once inhaled it deadens the senses and destroys the will with infallible surety. If indeed this narcotic is being brought into the Empire from or by the Hlyss, it is a matter of urgency indeed! The priest then set out upon the barge and after some adventures came out upon the seacoast, where he claims to have seen amighty ship of the Hlyss hidden in a cove. He would surely have perished, had not a company of the city troops come upon him. Shortly thereafter he requested transfer to the district near unto Fasiltum, where he now serves the local administrator of District Ferinara [hexes 3422 and 3423: Translator].

[Moderator's Note:  Evan switches gears from Pechano, to the Pariah deities. ]
[                   Everyone is intrigued by the Pariahs...                  ]

>It has often been said in The Blue Room, and in the sourcebooks that the
>worshippers of the Pariah Gods, and their temples were completely
>destroyed.How was such a massive undertaking accomplished? The resources

>monumental scale.

Why? The undertaking was not THAT _massive._  The Pariah Deities were 
never all that popular; the average Tsolyani was much more comfortable 
with accommodating gods and goddesses who fulfilled his/her personal 
needs without a lot of threatening theology. There were probably no 
more than a Pariah temple or two in any big city of the post-Engsvanyali 
age. The Priestkings themselves had pretty well contained the Pariah 
Gods' followers, suppressed, oppressed, and depressed them to the point 
that the weaker members were mostly gone (i.e. had joined other sects 
or were just "in name only" worshippers). There were still enclaves of 
Pariah Deity worship, particularly in remote areas, the mountains north 
of Tsolyanu, the northeastern areas around Hekellu and up through Sa'a 
Allaqi, etc.  Most of these were traditional: local villagers who 
followed the old religions because their forefathers had done so. There 
were only a few real practitioners by the time the early Tsolyani 
Emperors decided that enough was enough.

You can compare the destruction of this religious heritage to the 
crusade against the Cathars in France, led by Simon de Montfort the 
Elder in the 1200's.  A whole religious tradition was declared anathema 
and expunged, with attendant blood and fighting and disruption. Read 
the history of the Cathars' last fortress, Montsegur, some time.

>Prior to their destruction, were the followers of the
>Pariah Gods operating and worshipping openly? Or was there always an aura of
>secrecy associated to them?

The temples of the Pariah Deities were not secret until the very end. 
During Engsvanyali times, they were open and busy, though never as 
popular as those of Pavar's pantheon. They operated fairly openly right 
up until Trakonel's troops made it clear that this was the end of the 
line for them. Then the inner circles did whatever they could to 
disappear, to hide under other names and identities, to pretend they 
were members of the other sects, and to erase any memory of their being 
worshippers of these deities. Now they have become secret, rather like 
covens of Satanists in this day and age. A few ancient traditions are 
still observed, and it is said that there are still connections between 
these sects and some of the temples of Change -- but who knows?

>If secrecy was the rule then how did the
>Imperium find the Pariah Temples and bases? Did the OAL infiltrate the body

>a role did the other temples in the Imperium have in the destruction of the
>Pariah Gods worship?

The Imperium -- and the Mu'ugalavyani, Yan Koryani, and Livyani as 
well -- have efficient secret police. In these large, rigidly 
structured polities, the presence of police spies is taken for 
granted. The Five Empires probably shared information and made plans 
together to destroy these uncooperative alien influences. Consider the 
role of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. in modern American society: it would 
be very hard to hide a major movement, one that was quite inimical to 
the status quo. Informers would quickly point to the existence of 
wrongnesses and inconsistencies in the body politic, and further 
investigation would swiftly reveal the presence of the "secret" 
movement. Once discovered, infiltrators and double agents would soon 
find most of the important leaders and bring on the rigours of the 
inquisition! Innocent people are always hurt in such operations -- 
ask anybody who was anywhere near the Left during the McCarthy Era in 
the United States -- but the goal of eliminating the opposition does get 
done.

>Aproximately how long did it take to eradicate all of the known temples and
>places of worship? 

About 30 years during the long reign of Trakonel I "The Blazing Light." 
It was not finished then, of course, and in fact it still goes on.

>If today it was to come to the Imperium's attention that
>a temple or community of these followers still operated in Tsolyanu what
>type of reaction could we expect from the Emperor?

Emperor Dhich'une is now very busy fending off a major attack by Prince 
Taksuru from Bey Su, in which the forces of Prince Mirusiya from Fasiltum 
have joined. During calmer times, the Imperium would act swiftly to 
extirpate any revial of the Pariah Deities' sects: destruction and death, 
impalement and confiscation, as ruthless and complete as necessary, would 
be the order of the day. Even very powerful members of the Pariah Deities' 
sects, such as the wicked Lord Menggan hiTirrune, find it difficult to 
appear in public, now that their activities are known. 

I'll try to get to the long submission about Vra very soon, but I don't 
have the time right now. It is certainly an interesting piece!

[Moderator's Note:  Phil answers some more questions about Thayuri Island.  ]

>1. What does Tleku city look like?

It's a port city: wharves, warehouses, businesses, all at the western end, 
near the sea. Behind this, the city slopes up rapidly to a north-south 
crest that is the highest point of the island. There are palaces and 
temples built on these upper slopes. Behind the crest, to the northeast, 
the island slopes down very rapidly and ends up underwater, with muck, 
icky vegetation, and swamp creatures (most harmless: the big ones 
across the Bay have been eradicated on the island itself). The 
northwestern part of the island is covered with farms, fields, grape-
vineyards, etc. Inland, this region becomes mountainous and rugged, with 
deep ravines and steep hillsides -- the leftovers of the great catastrophe 
so many years ago. Between the two "arms" of the central range is a 
depression that is swampy and jungle-covered. Thayuri Isle is known for 
its wines and fine, reddish-purple Dlel-fruit. The islanders mainly live 
off sea products, however: fish, shellfish, various types of kelp-like 
plants that are tasty eating, cordage made from another sea plant, etc. 
There are pearls and a few other products, as well. The island also 
functions as a take-off point for shipping in the archipelago, across 
to Vra, south to Ganga Isle, etc. Most of the islanders are Stability 
worshippers, claiming to be descended from the Priestkings and their court. 

>2. What is the name of the river at whose mouth Tleku sits?

The Ma'an (stress on second "a'). I think. I don't have my original 
reference map in front of me right now, but I believe this is it. It's 
a short, tumultuous river, not very deep, but quite pretty. It rises 
in the central highlands and tumbles right down to the sea, where there 
is a north-south bridge that splits Old Tleku off from New Tleku to the 
south. Neither Old nor New Tleku are really old or new, of course -- the 
newest buildings on the island are the palaces and governmental offices 
of the Imperium, back up to the east behind the port. The port has an 
enclave of sailors and foreigners, as might be expected, with small 
districts devoted to Ahoggya and Shen -- no other nonhumans in any 
number -- and lots of Salarvyani, Haida Pakalani, and other human 
wanderers.

>3. What is the island's terrain like?

Described above.

>The maps say that the eastern half of the island degenerates into
>disgusting swampland; should we model the drier half on Phil's description
>of Lilsu Isle? I was intending to go for something a bit more rugged, on
>three grounds:

>the river (as given on the Tsolyani provincial map) is very winding 
>compared to others in Tsolyanu, possibly due to complicated rocky things; 

This is correct. Lilsu Isle is flatter, more rolling. Thayuri has a 
central rocky ridge, and the river is really a rough little stream.

>if the Engsvanyali catastrophe created geological chaos all over the
>planet (exciting new real estate opportunities on offer from Yan Kor Land
>Reclamation plc), why not have the eastern swamps formed by that end of

I think this is what I imply. The whole south sank somewhat, and the 
swamps were formed in the shallows of the low ground that was left. 
Ganga clearly is a tilted piece of real estate, sloping sharply down
to the east. Thayuri is similar, ut with less of a tilt since it had 
a higher central ridge in the first place.

>and I wanted an economic excuse (as well as just Tsolyani sluggishness)
>for the island to be more rather than less isolated, so I wasn't
>particularly keen on extensive fertile rolling countryside and vigorous 
>trade links based on the produce.

Sorry! Thayuri is not isolated but rather a busy little shipping port, 
with lots of products from Salarvya coming in that are shipped off to 
Tsolyanu and Mu'ugalavya (via Vra). The fruits and wines of Thayuri 
Isle are quite popular, and various sea delicacies are also dried, 
salted, etc. and sent off to other markets. Some of the old shipping 
clans have clanhouses here.

Not too far off. The temples, clanhouses, and government structures 
do climb back up away from the bright blue waters of the semi-circular 
port with its massive stone seawalls. There are no demolished blocks 
left, but the stone bridge that crosses the Ma'an is made of Engsvanyali 
masonry that has been reused. The highest ridge houses the Governor's 
palace, the temple of Hnalla, and the temple of Lady Avanthe. The other 
deities have shrines that are lower down, the farthest being that to 
Lord Ksarul off to the north end of the city along the ridge.

Hope this helps.

In response to Nikun hiSayodla of the Blue Hood clan, it is written:

The sinking of Ganga is fraught with legend and story. There are few 
contemporary records, and some of those are too wound up with mythological 
meanderings to be reliable as "history" (compare Plato on the subject of 
Atlantis, or various Middle Eastern sources on the Flood). The story of 
the Hero of the Age, the Warrior-Hero Kokun, and his attempts to defeat 
the Demons from Beyond, who brought about the sinking, take up a good 
part of the epic poetry dealing with this period. Kokun failed, betrayed
by a woman, and then by comrades who were not strong enough to succeed 
him. Hence, it is said, mighty Ganga sank, all in one long day during a 
beautiful summer day (exact Tsolyani date unknown). There had been 
rumblings and subsidences for some years, and the more timid folk had 
already left the island, some fleeing to Thayuri, some to Vra, some as 
far as Jakalla. The story has it that the island shivered once, twice, 
thrice, and then tilted gracefully to the east, bowing to the Lord Sun 
when he rose, and then disappeared beneath the waves. The accompanying 
roar and tumult was, literally, the end of the world for many. They say 
that the death of Ganga could be heard as far away as Thraya, though 
this may be hearsay. The tidal waves that roared in did take out most 
of the coastal cities as far away as Penom! All was dark, clouds of 
vapour and dust filled the sky, and the gods ground their mighty 
teeth together in horror...

This was the first of what seems to have been a long readjustment 
of the tectonic plates: northern Yan Kor rose, and the shallow inner 
sea was replaced with lowlands where Rulla and Eer and Go'on stand 
today. THe Desert of Sighs itself seems to be the lowest point of 
an ancient sea bottom. The catastrophe had ramifications in Mu'ugalavya 
and Salarvya, and high tides plagued Livyanu for years thereafter.

Many of the folk of Ganga had had warning and managed to get away. 
Much of their moveable property was saved along with them. Others 
refused to move, feeling that the Gods would take care of them -- 
which they did, as one poet put it, "by throwing open the gates to 
the Paradises of the Isles of Teretane."

>Was there a big bang and a crash, tidal waves, flying rock and a new 
>cartography needed?  This onslaught of destruction burns libraries and 
>loses treasures for ever and seems to be implied.

There was probably both a gradual subsidence and also a short, sharp 
catastrophe. The Priestkings apparently opted to stay with their 
palaces and gardens, although this is probably an exaggeration: many 
must have quietly fled to higher ground. 

The story has it that the waters roared down into the ancient underworld 
below the City of Ganga, drowning the tombs and catacombs, hurling the 
revered dead from their coffins, and bringing the roofs down with a 
thunder the like of which "no God had ever heard." There is no record 
of what happened to the creatures, guardians, and inhabitants of the 
tomb cities, but it is probable that most perished -- some may have 
got away across the Straits to what was then the pleasant woodland 
of Gilraya -- and is now a waterlogged morass.

All too true -- and possibly exactly as it happened. Even with a near-
instantaneous catastrophe, there must have been time for many denizens 
of the dark to win free and vanish to parts unknown.

The sinking of mighty Ganga still stands as one of the most moving and 
terrifying calamities that ever occurred. Far greater than one volcanic 
island of Thera (modern Santorini: where Atlantis is supposed have been), 
the fall of Ganga shook both the physical and the political world to its 
foundations. The forces of disruption soon triumphed over the shaken 
remnants of the Priestkings' administration, and whole provinces broke 
away within a few decades. The "lost armies" that had gone as far as 
old Mihallu and lost Tane, could not get home again and either perished 
or sent down roots and became local folk. Even the language slowly 
perished, giving way to the modern tongues of the Five Empires. 

The wings of the dark covered the eyes of light, as the poets say.

There are some sources, but not many that give realistic pictures of 
this period. Most,as said above, are wound about with myth snd story 
to the point that they are of little use as histories. If you are 
interested, check out the books listed on p 11 of the Zocchi Sourcebook.
"Pogurdikh hiKolumebabardali" by Kerulya Kettumridal of Jakalla is 
perhaps the most readable, although a knowledge of Engsvanyali is assumed.

Hope this helps,

Phil

Lnoris is a typical Vrayani city. Most of the inhabitants are followers 
of Lady Avanthe (or Dilinala), with a few members of other faiths. The 
industries are mostly connected with the sea, fishing, and transport of 
goods. Lnoris is one of the last good all-weather ports before the long 
trip north to Penom, one of the regular stops on the Salarvyanu-Tsolyanu-
Mu'ugalavya run. The stone seawall was built by the Engsvanyali, and it 
has been rebuilt and expanded by Emperor Hejjeka IV "Restorer of 
Dignities." The politics of Lnoris are relatively simple: worship Lady 
Avanthe, belong to one of the high Vrayani clans (Joyous of Vra is the 
best!), serve the local shipping interests, grow nice fruits and 
vegetables in your estate's gardens, hold lots of delicate parties and 
fetes to entertain your peers, and enjoy! The warm southern sunlight 
will lull you into sleepy lethargy, and you'll die a rich man with lots 
of kiddies by pretty Vrayani clangirls whom you can hardly remember... 
Thus, the Tsolyani author says, is the fate of those who dwell on Vra, 
the "Island of Softnesses." 

>Who are the notables of Lnoris? (Govenor, senior clergy, military figures,
>clan elders, etc.)

Sorry -- no time to fill out the roster. Chris, you have the character 
files; if you're in a jolly mood, you may be able to sort out some 
Vrayani and e-mail these on. ???

[Moderator's Note:  I'll see what I can do.                                 ]

>What does the title Duke of Lnoris actually mean?  (lands, political
>influence, social standing, etc.)

As said, the title of "Duke" is a poor translation of an ancient 
Engvanyali title that really means something like "Loyal Friend of 
the Throne." Your man is obviously an important clansman, and he will 
have the say over clan lands, agriculture, fishing, etc., together with 
the council of his peers in the clan. He'll be a player in local 
politics and will carry some weight in the councils of the City of Vra 
itself.


>I suspect that the north western coast is higher land with cliffs falling
>dramatically to the sea. Is this right? This is why Lnoris is the last good
>port on the run across to Penom on the way to the West?

You have it exactly right. The northern cliffs are not as high and 
steep as those of Dover, but they do make for glorious scenery. Lnoris 
has easy access across the "saddle" to the City of Vra, and timber for 
ships, tar, cordage, etc.  are shipped to it from Thayuri Isle and 
other places, including Salarvyani goods brought in to Vra and less 
commonly, Mu'ugalavyani products sent the other way to Salarvya. There 
is no large, safe harbour on the long point that faces Tleku across 
the Strait of Hanar, but little fishing boats and a few passenger craft 
do ply those waters.


==Blue Room Vol 10==
One difficulty is the use of composite bows by people who live on or 
near the sea. Salt water tends to loosen or destroy the glue that holds 
a bow's layers together. This is remedied by applications of a varnish-
like substance that is found along the coasts around Penom, in the 
southern islands (Thayuri, Burru, Ganga, etc.), and over to Kheiris in 
Mu'ugalavya and Hemektu in Livyanu. On every naval vessel you can see 
groups of sailors squatting around little braziers of coals, boiling 
their Ssun (the "u" is umlauted, with two dots on it) fruit. These 
inedible, yellowish bulbous fruit grow back in the forests and swamps 
all along the coast. The marine legions are adept at applying this.

I stand corrected. What I may have meant to say is that the Ksarul-myth is
drawn out of a historico-social context in which SOME elements of the
Pariah-myths were inserted (perhaps unconsciously) by the adherents of the
"new" faith. The Emergence of Ksarul in the Bednalljan Period is, by my
estimation, not "just" a coincidence of history -- I think the Bednalljans
were LED to Ksarul by forces/beings that they did not fully understand nor
appreciate. (More on this in the Tipika Hereziark'a) I would however love to
get my hands on some of the Inner Texts -- who is the best source in
Tsolyanu for this? Deragu hiFershena?

What was the first recorded "contact" with the Pariah Dieties? Who would be
the most likely "modern adherents" to the Pariah faith. (i.e. who is good
"heretic" material?) What of the religious life of the Three States of the
Triangle? Those guys are usually relegated by standard histories to "getting
their a---s kicked by the Nluss Dragon Warriors). There must have been a
little more to them than that! I should note that some fascinating
archeological sites were "discovered" recently in the swamps north of Penom
that would indicate some level of organized worship of the Pariah Dieities.
Even more ominous, some conjecture has been advanced to indicate that the
Ssu and/Hlyuss have had "contact" with the Goddess of the Pale Bone as late
as the fall of the Three States of the Triangle. It's still too early to
tell, but increased activities/forays into Tsolyanu have been reported as
far west as Penom.

Who currently "watches over" the proscribed texts? When was the last major
action taken against the Pariah Dieities' worshippers. If memory serves,
wasn't it Trankolel I (3rd Seal Emporer???) who led his armies against the
minions of the One Other? What precipitated this action? A Resurgence in the
"Old Faith"?

If I could get some advice on how to get past the Mu'ugalavyani -- I just
might pay a visit to SUNUZ. Perhaps via Nexal-Gate or tubeway car...Anybody
got any spare Navigation Disks? What is currently the situation there in
Livyanu? Has the Plague passed over? Why was it "artificial"? Who was behind
it then? Has the Forbidden City of Dlash been "breached" by Mu'ugalavyani
legions? My favorite nation has always been Livyanu -- I hate to see fall on
such hard times!

What sort of shared semantic or mythic-patterns do we find in source texts
(shared iconography?). Is there a "Rosetta Stone"-like treatise available in
Tsolyanu on this theological/conceptual "connection"? My own research has
dug up, in addition to the work I already mentioned, several Classical
Engsvanyali texts -- purporting to be "grammars" of some very odd dialects
of Duru'ob... as well as an Ai Che grammar by Kaijda hi'Gessumai of Purdimal
published during the reign of "The Spider" (Nriqu??) Emperor (only known
extant copy held by the Temple of Ksarul in that city). All works draw on
far older sources --some of which may well prove apocryphal. The most
interesting material, however, may be some alledged "translations" (in
Bednalljan Salarvyani) on Mihalli texts (Titles include: The Pandect of
Des'as'ura and The Codex of the Renderer of Veils  (an odd combination of
poetry and rituals related to "other planar voyages"). I will pass my
research along to you and the rest of this group as time permits.

I have/had no intention of laying into the old guy, I think Pavar was a
major figure in the emergence of a coherent(partailly), institutional
framework for religious worship. Like all good pupils, I have studied the
Scrolls of Pavar well. I only press the point that he "missed", whether
intentionally or not, some major aspects of the theology of the
Gods(Orthodox and otherwise). Pavar was a swell guy -- and the Golden Age of
Engsvan hla Ganga was a result!

He sounds like a scholar I would enjoy meeting with. Please give me some
more particulars about him (such as his physical description, personal
habits/tastes, clan, and most recent whereabouts). What can you tell me of
Hmakuyal -- I only know that it is the site of several important shrines to
Ksaruland now a set of "ruins"! I need travel directions! Being sequestered
in Bey Su until I can get Tsemel Ni'ur hiBurusa's notes and scholarly
materials released has put a definite crimp in my travel plans. Perhaps I
should just let by well connection clan brothers take over and hit the road
to Hmakuyal/Sunuz!

=AoT Part2.Vol2.21=

Each day the [Tsechelnu] Flats become more and more swampy, more miasmic. Great Horok-toads croak and splash in the ponds, and grey-black Qasu-birds squat upon the skeletal limbs of dead trees. In one village, your hosts also point out a Pallis or Pallis-marash, a thing that looks like a huge, dark blue ball the size of your head. It is covered with ropy, purply-red veins and rather resembles the "Food of the Ssu", to which it is related. You wonder why it is special. One of the peasants touches it with a stick, and the thing begins to move--by what means you cannot see--along the ground. "Crawls up to sleepin' folk 'n squirts poison on 'em," the man tells you. "Then it feeds on what's left." This time your shudder is obvious.

Somewhere close to a hundred Tsan father on the roadway ceases to be built of stone and becomes a timber causeway built up on pilings and gigantic balks of hard, black Tiu-wood buried deep in the oozing ground. Each night the insects crowd around your candles, lamps and fires, and the air stinks with the smell of cremated bugs! Your companions show you how to use tents and netting without setting yourself ablaze.

One evening you are startled by a deep, belling, rumbling roar far off in the bogs. Old RIkam hiGaragu, the caravan-master, sniffs and says, "Feshenga. Ever seen one? A lizardy-thing with oily black hide, and thirty pairs of legs." He spits into the embers of your cooking fire. "This'un's a big 'un, too. Don't want to cross him!"

By the time you have trudged across nearly a hundred Tsan more of rotting, weatherbeaten, grey planking, you rue the day you ever thought of Penom as a refuge! "Old Chlen-breath" probably has charms you overlooked.

The roadway makes one last turn between a pair of little hills: they must have been the summits of small mountains back in Engsvanyali times, before the earth shook and dragged mighty Ganga down below the waves. 

"There she is!" Rikam sings out, as cheery as a sea-Akho about to devour a shipful of fat and tasty merchants. "Penom!"

Penom is built on three low ridges at the southeastern corner of Bamesa Bay, which provides the best harbour along the coast. Indeed, in the distance you can just see the masts of the Flotilla of Hagarr of Paranta at the marine base of Gires farther back in the bay. Closer by, the wharves and warehouses of the shipping clans line the western shore of the harbour. Penom once had walls, but these defences are now little more than tumbled mounds of green-grown stones. Any threat, you surmise, must come from the sea.

The temples stand high on Metlunel Hill in the centre of the city; the Four Palaces occupy the summit of Kolumkan Ridge in the northwest, and the palace of the Governor covers the steep, craggy peninsual called the Crown of Hrugga in the souther corner. The slopes and hollows between are crammed with residences, commercial buildings and workshops.
